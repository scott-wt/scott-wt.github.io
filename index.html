    <h1>My name is Scott Connolly</h1>
	<p>I'm excited about taking Python next semester to improve my coding skills. I like biking, running, and working on home automation projects. Five years ago, I bought a robot lawn mower, which, despite being expensive, saved me from having to cut the grass, especially in this heat.</p>
